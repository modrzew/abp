As customary per year, the entire family is gathering on the island for a conference that discusses the current financial situations of each respective person. Because of the family head&#039;s poor health, this year involves the topic of the head of the family&rsquo;s inheritance and how it will be distributed.    However, the family is unaware that the distribution of his wealth is the least of Ushiromiya Kinzo&#039;s (family head) concerns for this year&#039;s family conference. After being told that his end was approaching by his longtime friend and physician, Kinzo is desperate to meet his life&#039;s true love one last time: the Golden Witch, Beatrice. Having immersed himself in black magic for many of the later years in his life, Kinzo instigates a ceremony to revive his beloved upon his family&#039;s arrival on Rokkenjima. Soon after, a violent typhoon traps the family on the island and a string of mysterious murders commence, forcing the eighteen people on the island to fight for their lives in a deadly struggle between fantasy and reality.

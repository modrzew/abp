They undergo counseling by Dr. Ichiro Irabu, who is the child-like son of the hospital director. His assistant is the sullen faced sexy nurse Mayumi.

Instead, they find that Irabu is an eccentric person, with childish features and with little or no sympathy. He employs drastic and unheard-of treatments, and instead of counselling, he prefers to look at his patients' background personally. Despite his strange behavior and methods, he can always help his patients find the real causes behind their symptoms, while being amused at the awkward situations, which the patients get into by following his advice.",

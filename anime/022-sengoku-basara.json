Sanada Yukimura and Date Masamune, two young warlords from different regions who become heated rivals, begin to form an unlikely alliance with the rest of the generals to take down the Devil King. The first season follows the emergence of the various protagonists, particularly Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura, and their struggle against Nobunaga, who seeks to unite the land under him and is willing to crush anyone, even his own allies, to do it. It ends with his defeat at Masamune and Yukimura's hands. The second season witnesses the emergence of Toyotomi Hideyoshi as the next potential unifier of the land, though unlike in actual history he has no connection to Nobunaga, whose retainers were almost entirely wiped out along with him by the end of the first season. It ends with Toyotomi Hideyoshi's defeat at the hands of Date Masamune, while Sanada Yukimura was busy fighting and defeating M\u014dri Motonari.",

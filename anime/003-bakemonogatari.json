One day, a classmate named Senjougahara Hitagi, who infamously never talks to anyone, falls down the stairs into Koyomi's arms. He discovers that Hitagi weighs next to nothing, in defiance of physics. After being threatened by her, Koyomi offers her help, and introduces her to Oshino Meme, a middle-aged homeless man who helped him stop being a vampire.Info: In each chapter of the series, he encounters a different heroine, each involved with a different \"apparition\". The events of the previous chapters play an important role in the subsequent ones. The series primarily focuses on conversations between characters; it contains a fair number of parodies of other series, as well as Nisio Ishin's trademark wordplay and meta-humour.Note: Episodes 13-15 (Tsubasa Cat parts 3-5) never received a TV broadcast, but instead were streamed online on the anime's official website.",

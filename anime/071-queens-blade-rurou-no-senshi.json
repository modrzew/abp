For one woman warrior however, an early defeat clearly shows her that she is lacking in experience though she may be bountiful in body.    Fortunately, while defeat could spell one&#039;s doom, her life is saved by a powerful stranger. But unfortunately for this savior, less-than-pure motives and shrewd family members mean her reward is a prison cell. Her release is prompt when the unseasoned warrior she saved, tired of her current lifestyle of nobility, sets off to prove herself.    (Source: Media Blasters)",

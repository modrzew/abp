Her magic ability is \"Sensory Fibres\", which allows her to observe locations from afar. Her fibres, fully emitted, can reach approximately 50 kilometers, while the number of fibres emitted reaches over billions. According to Minth's Sacred Eyes ability, her main trait is self-loathing, her thoughts are void, and she wishes for love.

She is in love with Volken.   Volken Macmani (\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30b1\u30f3\uff1d\u30de\u30af\u30de\u30fc\u30cb, Voruken Makum\u0101ni?) Voiced by: Yuichi Nakamura A young Armed Librarian. He has green hair and usually wears standard Armed Librarian robes. His sense of justice is unrivaled. His weapons are flying razor-sharp disks that he can control at will.

Ruruta Coozancoona (\u30eb\u30eb\u30bf\uff1d\u30af\u30fc\u30b6\u30f3\u30af\u30fc\u30ca, Ruruta K\u016bzank\u016bna?) Voiced by: Takahiro Sakurai The Director and founder of the Bantorra Library.

He is a lonely man who is so strong that he fears his own power. During a war between the Bantorra Library and The Empire, he felt guilty after killing so many people, therefore he locked himself deep in the labyrinth beneath Bantorra Library. His magic ability is to control armies of flesh-consuming ants.   Ireia Kitty (\u30a4\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\uff1d\u30ad\u30c6\u30a3, Ireia Kiti?)

Chacoly Cocotte (\u30c1\u30e3\u30b3\u30ea\u30fc\uff1d\u30b3\u30b3\u30c3\u30c8, Chakor\u012b Kokotto?) Voiced by: Ai Nonaka A childhood friend of Hamyuts. She is also known as \"The Violet Sinner\". Her ability is \"Soul Transference\", an ability that is similar to Mirepoc's telepathy but of higher level, as it can control the minds of people by injecting part of her soul.   Fhotona (\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30ca\uff1d\u30d0\u30fc\u30c9\u30ae\u30e3\u30e2\u30f3, Fotona B\u0101dogyamon?) The previous Acting Director who served directly before Hamyuts. He was a mentor to Volken. As Hamyuts rises through the ranks of the Armed Librarians, she orders Mattalast to murder her while the two of them are on a mission to kill Hiza the traitor. He fears she will become too powerful, far surpassing everyone in the library.   Makia (\u30de\u30ad\u30a2\uff1d\u30c7\u30ad\u30b7\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8, Makia Dekishi\u0101to?) The Acting Director of Bantorra Library who served three terms before Hamyuts Meseta. After being asked by \"Heaven\" (Ruruta Coozancoona) to find a way to kill him, Makia created Chacoly and Hamyuts for that purpose.

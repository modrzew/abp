The title, Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku (Reform with no Wasted Draws), is a parody of Koizumi Jun'ichirou's slogan, \"Seiiki Naki Kaikaku\" (Reform with no Sanctuary, \u8056\u57df\u7121\u304d\u6539\u9769).Although based on real-life politicians, the characters are, as the disclaimer notes, \"works of fiction and not really related to any real-life people\".",

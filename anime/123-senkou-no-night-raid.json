Ten years before America will enter World War II, the hydra&#039;s teeth planted by the first great global conflict are beginning to germinate. Hatching like spiders, they weave the complex web of plots and conspiracies destined to inevitably draw entire nations to the brink of destruction. Caught in the heart of these webs, desperately seeking to separate lies from truth, is &quot;Sakurai Kikan,&quot; an ultra-secret intelligence agency staffed by extraordinarily talented individuals with abilities far beyond those of normal humans. Their duty: to stop the darkest plots and eliminate the greatest threats. But in a city built on intrigue, can even a team of clairvoyants, telepaths and espers stand against the ultimate forces of destiny?    (Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

In this cosmopolitan city of intrigue lies a small spy organization, which history would later forget, led by a man named Sakurai Shin'ichirou. What Sakurai's group does for a living could best be described as sorting out the mess in situations through which a regular group of spies wouldn't last; the amazing survival abilities of its members are a result of their super powers. However, a big plan starts to unfold in front of Sakurai and his men; that plan involves traitors and spies, politics and domination, tears and blood. No matter how strong a super power is, it also has its limits, and that holds true for Sakurai's men as well; when faced against the enemy behind that plan, an enemy that also has people with super powers among its ranks, how far will their own powers take them?",

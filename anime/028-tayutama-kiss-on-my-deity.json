One day during spring break, Yuuri and his friends Ameri and Sankurou discover a wooden relic which bears mysterious symbols in the school's woods. The relic turns out to host the Tayutai race which the shrine worships, but is deemed to be insignificant for preservation by the school, and will be demolished to allow the school grounds' expansion. Yuuri later sneaks into the school to transfer the relic's spirits, after coming to the conclusion that destroying the relic may be harmful. As he performs the ritual, he accidentally summons Kikuramikami no Hime, a Tayutai goddess who explains the belligerent relationship between humans and Tayutai, and materializes as a young girl, hoping to maintain a mutual relationship with humans. The relic is then destroyed after an accident caused by Ameri, which accidentally releases the entire Tayutai race, among whom are Nue and Oryu, two other influential Tayutai who hold humans in low regard.Source: Wikipedia",

Okay, that last part&#039;s a little bit unusual, but his family lives in a shrine and they do that sort of thing.  Still, you would think he&#039;d know enough to be careful with an ancient relic he finds in the woods, especially when a mysterious goddess appears and tells him to leave it alone.  Unfortunately, despite Mito&#039;s best efforts, the seal gets broken anyway and a number of dangerous &quot;tayuti&quot; that it held in stasis get loose.  This is bad.  Mito also ends up with a beautiful goddess girl who decides that she&#039;s going to marry him.  This might not be so bad. if he wasn&#039;t already caught up in the middle of a war between the entities he&#039;s released.  The flesh may be weak but the spirit&#039;s more than willing to compensate.     (Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Sousei Academy consists of two departments: a notorious all-girls department named Flawless (\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9, Fur\u014dresu?), which stems its roots from the Sousei Girls' Academy established during the Meiji period; and a recently added coeducation department named Slightly (\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc, Suraitorii?). The campus grounds are separated into two parts which houses the two separate departments. Students attending the Flawless department lives in a dormitory across from the school building, which is separated from Slightly's school building and schoolyard by a small forest. The supernatural is a recurring theme in Tayutama. The mythological race Tayutai (\u592a\u8ee2\u4f9d?) is worshiped by the Yachimata Shrine,[1] and is able to take shape in various forms such as humans. Various characters also possess supernatural abilities, such as Yuuri who excels in shinto studies, and Mashiro who is a Tayutai. Yumina gains wings which enables her to fly, and Ameri can also command a Tayutai. Mifuyu is favored by Nue, a Tayutai, and is physically powerful enough to engage a Tayutai in battle.",

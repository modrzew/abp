After moving into his brother&rsquo;s old house, Tomoharu expects to continue living his normal life but is one day left with a mysterious and locked briefcase without any instruction. At first he plans to leave it in storage, however his house is soon invaded by multiple groups of people after the briefcase. Although still not knowing the purpose of the briefcase, Tomoharu and Misao attempt to escape with it.    From there on, Tomoharu tries to learn the secrets behind the briefcase, the connections between it and Misao and why it has the power to change the world.    [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He has had a ghost of his childhood friend Misao as his companion ever since he was involved in an accident he could not remember. As if this was not strange enough, he was caught in a struggle between several factions of the school he is about to be a part of, the moment a suitcase was entrusted to him by Kurosaki Shuri, who is supposedly a friend of his brother Natsume Naotaka. One faction had glowing eyes, another had a cyborg-body, and yet another used a robot-like servant. This completely out-of-the-blue incident is but a beginning to Tomo's supposed school life as everything begins to spiral out of his control, even as he searches for an answer to all of these things that he had never heard of and known before; and why is he and Misao involved in all of these.",

Voiced by: Aoi Y\u016bki (Japanese), Monica Rial (English) The female protagonist and the current ruler of the Vampire world. She usually appears in a young and prepubescent state, though she is not shy enough to feel embarrassed when naked. Mina can act aggressive, cocky, and naughty. However, she actually feels vulnerable and lonely. She cares very much for the welfare of her people and does everything in her power to protect and preserve her species. Mina sympathizes towards the Fangless (vampires who ripped out their own fangs), creating a city underneath the Bund where they can live freely and without persecution. It is revealed that she is in love with Akira since first meeting him or related to him in a close fashion, to the point her secret room is covered from floor to ceiling with nothing but pictures of him. Mina's soul's true form is an adult version of herself with wings. She wishes to have this form kept a secret, as that form's body is able to give birth while her current one cannot, and because of that, she would be forced into marrying one of the Three Nobles, who are also \"True Bloods\" like her. Mina's name can be derived from the Vlad the Impaler story and Dracula. Tepe\u015f is the Romanian word for Impaler, the reason Vlad the Impaler is called Vlad Tepe\u015f, and Mina was the name of the woman that Dracula sought to have as his new bride in the original novel.   Akira Kaburagi Regendorf (\u6681\u30fb\u93d1\u6728\u30fb\u30ec\u30fc\u30b2\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30d5, Akira Kaburagi R\u0113gendorufu?) Voiced by: Yuichi Nakamura (Japanese), Alpha Lagrange (English) The male protagonist of the story. A young werewolf who is the son of Wolfgang and thus is well trained. He has undergone training to identify almost all explosives, learning how to sniff them out. He cannot however disarm them, as he only took the canine part of the program. He is a kind person, determined to protect Mina, with whom he is in love. In the anime, he lost all of his memories one year ago, and did not even know he was a werewolf until episode 2. It is later revealed he lost his memory due to failing a mission, and was allowed to live because of his importance to Mina.   Yuki Saegusa (\u4e09\u679d \u7531\u7d00, Saegusa Yuki?) Voiced by: Chiwa Sait\u014d (Japanese), Alexis Tipton (English) The narrator of the story. A human who, it is later revealed, was once Akira's girlfriend. She gave Akira a silver ring as a symbol of their relationship, which later, she gave to Mina as a symbol of their new friendship. She is Akira's classmate as well as a member of the Student Council, and for a time being the only member after the attack on Kaichou. She was at first frightened by vampires, but grows to accept them after spending time with Mina. Through this she appears to gain a close friendship with Mina, even inviting her to spend the night at her house. Yuki is also an amateur novelist, and has quite a following in the Bund. It is suggested she writes yaoi with the protagonist based on Akira, much to his horror.",

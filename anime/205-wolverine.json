It is in Shingen's mansion that Logan finds Mariko, who had been brought back to Japan against her will. It is Shingen's intention for Mariko to marry an influential person so as to seal a political alliance between that person and Kuzuryuu.During Logan's attack on Shingen's mansion, in a fight with his bodyguards, Logan is struck by a needle. The needle is coated with a poison which greatly reduces his regenerative abilities. In his weakened state, he is no match for Shingen and is defeated in a duel and left for dead.Logan is discovered on the verge of death by the mysterious Yukio. With Yukio's ministrations, Logan eventually recovers and the two join together in a second bid to take down Shingen.~ translated and adapted from official site by Cranston Note: Episode 1 received a private pre-airing on 16.12.2010 in Shinjuku Wald9 Cinema.
